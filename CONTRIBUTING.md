# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing. It’s people like you who make Stable Diffusion such a great tool.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have a GitHub account and that you have forked the repository to your own GitHub account. Clone it to your local machine to begin making changes.

## Making Changes

Here's a quick rundown of how you should go about making a change:

1. **Create your own branch** from `develop`:
Avoid making changes in the `develop` branch directly. Instead, create a new branch for your changes. Use a short, descriptive name for your branch, like `feature-enhance-ui` or `bugfix-ui-state-save`.

2. **Make your changes**:
Implement your changes, adhering to the coding conventions and standards.

3. **Commit your changes**:
Make sure your commit messages are clear and follow the best practices. E.g., "Add feature to ..." or "Fix issue with ..."

4. **Pull the latest changes from `develop`**:
Before submitting a pull request, make sure your branch is up to date with the latest changes in the `develop` branch.

5. **Push your changes**:
Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

6. **Submit a pull request**:
Open a pull request from your branch to the `develop` branch of the original repository. Provide a concise and informative title and description for your pull request. Link any relevant issues.

## After Your Pull Request is Merged

Once your pull request is merged, you might want to clean up your branches and pull the latest changes from the main repository to ensure your local copy is up-to-date.

## Additional Guidance
